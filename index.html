    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for 
    an hour now. On her desk. lying between the copies
    of <i>Nature</i>. <i>New Scientist</i>. and all
    the other scientific journalsher work had 
    appeared in. was a well thumbed copy of <cite> On 
    The Road</cite>. It had been Molly,s favorite Book
    since college. and the longer she spent in these
    four walls the more she felt she needed to be
    free </p>
<p>She had spent the last ten year in this room,
    sitting under a poster woth an Oscar Wild quote
    proclaiming that <q>Work is th refige of
    people who have nothing better to do</q>. All though
    many considered her pioneering work, unrevalling 
    the secret of the llama <abbr 
    title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an 
    outstanding achievements, Molly <em>did</em> think
    she had somethingbetter to do.
